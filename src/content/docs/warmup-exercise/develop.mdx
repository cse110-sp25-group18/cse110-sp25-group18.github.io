## Architecture Overview

This document outlines the architecture of the card game application, which follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern with a clear separation between System and Player components.

## Architectural Patterns

### MVC Architecture

The application follows the Model-View-Controller pattern:

- **Models**: Responsible for data management and business logic
  - `SystemModel.js`: Manages deck, game rules, and calculations
  - `PlayerModel.js`: Manages player and dealer hands and states
  - `CardModel.js`: Represents a card's data (suit, rank, state)

- **Views**: Handle UI rendering and user interaction
  - `SystemView.js`: Renders system components (deck, counters, admin controls)
  - `PlayerView.js`: Renders player components (hands, action buttons)
  - `CardView.js`: Custom element for rendering individual cards

- **Controllers**: Coordinate models and views
  - `GameController.js`: Main controller orchestrating game flow
  - `CardController.js`: Controls individual card behavior

### Factory Pattern

The `CardFactory` in `card.js` implements the factory pattern to create cards:
- Creates card components with proper MVC structure
- Registers custom elements
- Provides convenience methods for card creation

## Initialization Flow

1. The application starts in `main.js` when the DOM is loaded
2. `GameController` is instantiated, which:
   - Creates models (SystemModel, PlayerModel)
   - Creates views (SystemView, PlayerView)
   - Initializes the game by creating and shuffling a deck
   - Binds event handlers

## Game Flow

1. **Game Initialization**:
   - Deck is created with 52 cards (4 suits Ã— 13 ranks)
   - Cards are arranged in a stack
   - UI counters are updated

2. **New Game**:
   - Hands are cleared
   - Initial cards are dealt (2 to player, 2 to dealer with one face down)
   - Blackjack checks are performed

3. **Player Turn**:
   - Player can Hit (take another card) or Stand (end turn)
   - Bust condition is checked after each Hit

4. **Dealer Turn**:
   - Dealer reveals face-down card
   - Dealer draws cards according to rules (hits until 17+)
   - Bust condition is checked after each draw

5. **End Game**:
   - Winner is determined
   - Results are displayed
   - Game can be reset or a new game started

## Component Interaction

- `GameController` orchestrates all game components
- Card interactions are managed through `CardController`
- Models communicate state changes to controllers
- Controllers update views based on model changes
- Views trigger events that controllers handle

## UI Components

- **System Components**: Deck, card counter, admin controls, game controls
- **Player Components**: Player hand, dealer hand, action buttons
- **Card Components**: Individual cards with flip animation

## Event Handling

The application uses a centralized event handling approach:
- Events are bound in the `GameController`
- Views expose methods to bind handlers
- Controllers process events and update models/views accordingly

## Custom Elements

The application uses Web Components:
- `CardView` is registered as a custom element (`card-element`)
- This allows encapsulation of card behavior and styling

## Future Development

For future development, consider:

1. Adding more game variants
2. Implementing player accounts and statistics
3. Adding multiplayer functionality
4. Enhancing animations and visual effects
5. Implementing advanced betting mechanics
